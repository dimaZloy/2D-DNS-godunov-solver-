# 2D-DNS-parallel-godunov-solver
# Direct Numerical simulations (DNS) of the supersonic flow over a circular cylinder at Mach number, M = 3.5.  2D Navier-Stokes equations are computed using the Godunov-type approach based on the 2nd order finite-volume method coupled with the AUSM+ flux splitting method. First order explicit Euler scheme is applied for time integration (it seems it works fine and comparable with alternative RK methods and BDF-2).  High performance parallelism is achieved suing a simple threads mechanism implemented in the Julia HPC language.  The latest tested mesh contains 1.04M nodes and 2.08M triangular cells. The Numerical Schrilen visualization of the flow is provided below:
